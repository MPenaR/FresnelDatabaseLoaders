# FresnelDatabaseLoaders
A repository with a couple of loaders in different languages for the [Institut Fresnel two dimensional experimental database](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/17/6/301). The original files can be downloaded from the sumplementary data section. 


## Python

The python loader returns two 'numpy.NDarray'  objects containing the incident field and the scattered field per each batch of experiments.
